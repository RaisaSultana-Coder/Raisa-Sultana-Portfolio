          <h3>Phishing Detection Through Hybrid Machine Learning Based On URL</h3>
          <p>Phishing attacks are a major cybersecurity threat where attackers impersonate legitimate websites to steal sensitive user information such as login credentials, financial data, and personal details. Traditional blacklist-based detection methods are often ineffective against newly generated phishing sites. This project aims to develop a more robust and intelligent phishing detection system using a hybrid machine learning model that analyzes URL-based features.</p>

          <h3>Improved Trust In Human Collaboration with Chatgpt</h3>
          <p>Incorporating ChatGPT into human-robot collaboration (HRC) systems can significantly improve trust between humans and robots, making them more effective collaborators. This is primarily due to ChatGPT's ability to facilitate better communication, understand human language nuances, and build a more intuitive and natural interaction. Studies have shown that using ChatGPT in robots allows humans to control them using natural language, leading to increased trust and reduced cognitive load. </p>

          <h3>Conversational AI With Spring Boot Open API & Ollama a Smarter Chatbot Solution</h3>
          <p>This project aims to develop an intelligent, locally deployable chatbot platform that combines the power of Spring Boot for backend management, OpenAPI for standardized documentation and API interaction, and Ollama to run large language models efficiently on edge devices. The chatbot provides human-like, contextual conversations and can be extended for various domains like customer service, education, or healthcare</p>
